      <h1>Contact Me</h1>
      <p>
        You can contact me by creating an account on my website, called
        <a href="https://alexerdei73.github.io/fakebook/">Fakebook</a>
        I keep an eye on the website and there is messanger feature, come and
        say hi. I will answer:) You can also post even YouTube videos there,
        there are no crazy rules. This is free speach. It would be nice if you
        could upload a profile picture, just because it is better to talk to
        somebody with a face. The only thing, you need is a real email for
        registration. The app sends email verification and you will not be able
        to use it until you verify your email.
